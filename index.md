I'm a software engineering student at the University of Waterloo.

I have a bunch of projects on [GitHub]. I have a few [project summaries][projects]. You may also want to take a look at my [résumé][resume], which includes my email.

## Things I do

I solve problems on [Project Euler][pe]. At the time of writing, I am 11th in Canada and in the top 1000 worldwide.

I speak Esperanto (*Mi parolas Esperanton*). Recently I've also resumed studying Lojban (*.i mi puzidi'a tadni lo jbobau*). I also took a weekend and learned Toki Pona (*mi kama sona e toki pona*). I like conlangs.

I write stuff. Or I'm starting to write stuff, at least. Check out my [blog][blog].
